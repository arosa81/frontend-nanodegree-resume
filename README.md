## Interactive Resume

Using jQuery, developed an interactive resume application that reads all data from a JSON file and then dynamically modifies the DOM to display the information. Further customized the project by personalizing the design using CSS.

### The process I followed:
The resume has four distinct sections: work, education, projects and a header with biographical information.

1. Followed and MVC architectural pattern
1. **Model:**
  1. Built four JSONs, each one representing a different resume section.
1. **View:**
  1. Displays formatted content for each resume section.
  1. The resume includes an interactive google map with additional features implemented via the Google Maps API.
1. **Controller:**
  1. Manipulates the model for correct text replacement and formatting
  1. Communicates with the View for updated display of resume sections

**Note:** Please view the **src** folder for readable source code
